# NewSS App

#### To Implement
- Logging: use Firsbase + social media signing, keep track of log ins locally to check to see if a login is required.
- Favorite: Either use json format or just write .txt and process it.
- Given that the search result does not bring anything up, return a message within the search area indicating this!

This app is a side project that I worked on to practice building apps with flutter. It fetches new articles from [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) then it is rendered in real time. They are three main tabs for navigation:


# 1. Main Page 

Latest News is rendered on this tab.

<img src="./img/main.jpg" width=30% alt="main"/>

# 2. Favorites Page
The articles that the user has identified as favorite will be saved here. Also, its background colour will change to indicate the article being liked.

<img src="./img/favorites.jpg" width=30% alt="favorites"/>  |
  
# 3. Search Page
In this tab, anything could be searched by typing in the search bar.

<img src="./img/search.jpg" width=30% alt="search"/>
